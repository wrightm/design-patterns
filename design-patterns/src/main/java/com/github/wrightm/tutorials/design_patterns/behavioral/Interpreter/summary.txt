Motivation

The Interpreter is one of the Design Patterns published in the GoF which is not really used. 
Usually the Interpreter Pattern is described in terms of formal grammars, 
like it was described in the original form in the GoF but the area where this design pattern can be applied can be extended.

Intent

- Given a language,
define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

- Map a domain to a language, 
the language to a grammar, 
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design

Implementation

The implementation of the Interpreter pattern is just the use of the composite pattern applied to represent a grammar. 
The Interpreter defines the behaviour while the composite defines only the structure.
