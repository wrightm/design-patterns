Used to encapsulate different object behaviors and allows them to be easily interchangeable by assigning responsibility to an object to decide when to use a particular behavior.

Advantages:

Separates code that changes from code that stays the same. Example A Dancer Class, we could pull out dance moves as a behavior.
